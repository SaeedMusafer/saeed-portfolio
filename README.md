This is a [Next.js] project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`].

## Getting Started

First install next.js, if not installed:

<!-- # open terminal or bash in saeed-portfolio directory and run -->
```bash
npm install next

```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


[API routes] can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`] to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
